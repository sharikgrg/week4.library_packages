# Libraries, Packages

This class will cover what is in the title

## Definitions 

#### Libraries
These built into python / standard in python.
You need to import them to use.
These are still considered vanilla python.

#### Modules
These are internal, and you import them to use else where in the code.
We build lots of them in OOP, but they can also be functional.

#### Packages
These are external and needed to be installed.
You can install them using PIP or using Pycharm.

Pycharm, creates it's own Virtual Environment (VE) to avoid cross contamination.
